# OC Project 1

## Structure

This project consists of three cache simulators, each located in a separate directory:

1. **L1**: A simulator for an L1 cache.
2. **L2**: A simulator for an L2 cache.
3. **L22**: A simulator for a 2-way set associative L2 cache.

Each cache simulator uses predefined constants to simulate access times
